# Projet_BDD_Web
Web and database programming project carried out in first year at ENSC (Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure de Cognitique).
The aim of the project is to create a website that reproduces the concept of interactive series (e.g. Black Mirror, Bandersnatch) and to offer users the chance to follow a story while being able to influence its course through a series of choices throughout the adventure.
